# Financial-and-Poll-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

This repository consists of two analysis: Financial data analysis and the Poll data analysis, both performed in Python.

# Financial Data Analysis

In this analysis, the python script runs over the financial records to uncover the following insights. The total number of months in the dataset, the total net amount of profit/losses, and the average change in the period is calculated to understand the differences in profit/losses. The most significant increase in profits and the greatest decrease in losses over the entire period is printed. The script is written to read the CSV file, uncover the insights mentioned above, and write the same findings into a text file.

# Getting Started with Financial Analysis

1. Please find the dataset in PyBank/Resources folder. It is a CSV file.
2. Please find the text file that has the results of the analysis in PyBank/Analysis. It is a .txt file
3. The PyBank main.py is the python script that has been written to run on the dataset and write the results to the text file.

# Polling Data Analysis

The script is written to automate the process of finding the total votes and declaring the winner. The polling dataset has many data, and the most straightforward data analytics tool like Excel cannot handle the Big data. Therefore, Python has been used to automate the process and find the winner.

# Getting Started with Polling Data Analysis

1. Please find the dataset in PyPoll/Resources folder. It is a CSV file.
2. Please find the text file that has the results of the analysis in PyPoll/Analysis. It is a .txt file
3. The PyPoll main.py is the python script that has been written to run on the dataset and write the results to the text file.
